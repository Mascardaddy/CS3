		<li>Its just addicting to watch random, nonsense videos on YouTube even though I may learn nothing from them. Most teenagers this day and age enjoy these types of content and maybe that is why I, myself do as well.</li>
		<li>YouTube can also be used for learning or studying. How to bake a cake, how to greet someone in France, daily news in China, or even your math homework.</li>
		<li>Other than content, YouTube is very easy to use. With only a few to no bugs, everything on the website works really fast.</li>
