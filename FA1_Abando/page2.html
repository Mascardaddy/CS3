		<li>Facebook's main purpose is for people to connect with friends, family, celebrities, or even strangers you've never met to keep up with their current lives through images, stories, or videos they upload on their profile.</li>
		<li>It is connected to Messenger, a messaging app also under meta. You can contact anyone, make group chats, and even connect with Instagram users, because of its partnership with Facebook which I think is pretty neat.</li>
		<li>Personally, I mostly use Facebook for Messenger to keep up with school. That is because they use Messenger as our main contacting service.</li>
