				<h1>What is a capybara?</h1>
				<p>Either of two species of the capybara, genus Hydrochoerus, often known as
				carpincho or water hog, are enormous semiaquatic rodents from South 
				America. From Panama to Argentina, capybaras live in marshes and forested
				areas. The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), the bigger of the two 
				species, is the biggest living rodent in the world, reaching lengths of up to 1.3
				meters (4.3 feet) and weights of up to 79kg (174 pounds). The tiny lesser 
				capybara (H. isthmius) weighs around 28kg and can grow to be about 1 meter
				(about 3 feet) long (62 pounds). Capybaras are included in the subfamily
				Hydrochoerinae of the family Caviidae in some classifications, but they are the 
				only members of the family Hydrochoeridae in others. Capybaras resemble the guinea pig and the cavie.</p>

				<p>Capybaras are brownish rodents with short hair and nearly no tail. They also have short legs and tiny 
				ears. 
				They gather in groups along the sides of rivers and lakes because they are bashful. They typically eat in 
				the morning and evening and rest most of the day
				along the banks in cover. They consume melons, grain, and squash and occasionally turn into pests in 
				agricultural regions. They
				frequently enter the water to avoid predators like jaguars and anacondas and can swim and 
				dive with ease. Every year, the female gives birth to a single litter that
				ranges in size from three to eight pups.</p>
