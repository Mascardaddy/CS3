					<p>
					Around 80 million years ago, in Africa, the capybara's 
					progenitors underwent evolutionary change before migrating 
					to South America 40 million years later. All of it's relatives 
					are rodents of typical size; for example, the related rock cavies, 
					which are found in the scrublands of eastern Brazil, barely weigh two pounds each.
					Their findings are consistent with the theory that capybaras originated from a tiny progenitor, 
					around the size of a guinea pig, and that their current huge size is the consequence of many evolutonary growth spurts.

					Capybaras are now found in Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Peru, Brazil, Paraguay, Northeast Argentina and Uruguay. 
					They are semi-aquatic and will spend most of their time in dense vegetation around rivers, lakes, ponds, marshes and swamps.
					Rodents tend to be tiny because smaller animals can hide better, and much larger predators may consider them not worth the effort, explains Duke University evolutionary biologist V. Louise Roth. But at the time the capybaras arrived in South America, 
					the region was almost completely devoid of predators, which may have allowed their ancestors to start getting bigger.
