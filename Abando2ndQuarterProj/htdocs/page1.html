					<p>
					Capybaras are brownish rodents with short hair and nearly no tail. They also have short legs and tiny ears. They gather in groups 
					along the sides of rivers and lakes because they are bashful. They typically eat in the morning and evening and rest most of the day 
					along the banks in cover. They consume melons, grain, and squash and occasionally turn into pests in agricultural regions. They frequently 
					enter the water to avoid predators like jaguars and anacondas and can swim and dive with ease. Every year, the female gives birth to a 
					single litter that ranges in size from three to eight pups.

					Either of two species of the capybara, genus Hydrochoerus, often known as carpincho or water hog,
					are enormous semiaquatic rodents from South America. From Panama to Argentina, capybaras live in marshes and forested areas. 
					The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), the bigger of the two species, is the biggest living rodent in the world, reaching lengths 
					of up to 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) and weights of up to 79kg (174 pounds). The tiny lesser capybara (H. isthmius) weighs around 28kg and
					can grow to be about 1 meter (about 3 feet) long (62 pounds). Capybaras are included in the subfamily Hydrochoerinae of the family Caviidae in some classifications, 
					but they are the only members of the family Hydrochoeridae in others. Capybaras resemble the guinea pig and the cavie.
